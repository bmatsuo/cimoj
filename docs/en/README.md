#Cimoj

Cimoj is a puzzle game clone of Critter Crunch.  The mechanics of Cimoj are
like Critter Crunch but the game is played in your favorite terminal editor.

The goal of Cimoj is to match the mechanics of Critter Crunch and provide and
open and extendable level design system.  Players will be able to create,
package, and share their own puzzles and challenges freely.

Currently the core game mechanics are still being implemented.  Only the
Survival game mode can be played.
